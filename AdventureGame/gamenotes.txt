Adventurer class (subclass of person class?)
Item class
Location class
Input class?
Display class
Encounter class?

locations define the way screens look...
If there's too much text on a card, the screen function should automatically hold it in a scrolling state
If there're too many options to display, screen should break them into blocks and track which block is current.
Card is loaded to screen object, which then displays & interacts.
